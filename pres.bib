	abstract = {Under suitable assumptions, some recently developed quantum algorithms can estimate the ground-state energy and prepare the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian with near-optimal query complexities. However, this is based on a block-encoding input model of the Hamiltonian, the implementation of which is known to require a large resource overhead. We develop a tool called quantum eigenvalue transformation of unitary matrices with real polynomials (QETU), which uses a controlled Hamiltonian evolution as the input model, a single ancilla qubit, and no multiqubit control operations and is thus suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. This leads to a simple quantum algorithm that outperforms all previous algorithms with a comparable circuit structure for estimating the ground-state energy. For a class of quantum spin Hamiltonians, we propose a new method that exploits certain anticommutation relations and further removes the need to implement the controlled Hamiltonian evolution. Coupled with a Trotter-based approximation of the Hamiltonian evolution, the resulting algorithm can be very suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm using IBM qiskit for the transverse-field Ising model. If we are further allowed to use multiqubit Toffoli gates, we can then implement amplitude amplification and a new binary amplitude-estimation algorithm, which increases the circuit depth but decreases the total query complexity. The resulting algorithm saturates the near-optimal complexity for ground-state preparation and energy estimation using a constant number of ancilla qubits (no more than three).},

However, QPE requires a large number of ancilla qubits and a large circuit depth, as well as the ability to perform inverse quantum Fourier transform, making it expensive to implement on an early fault-tolerant quantum computer. We propose an alternative method to estimate the ground-state energy of a Hamiltonian with Heisenberg-limited precision scaling, which employs a simple quantum circuit with one ancilla qubit, and a classical postprocessing procedure. Besides the ground-state energy, our algorithm also produces an approximate cumulative distribution function of the spectral measure, which can be used to compute other spectral properties of the Hamiltonian.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of noise in quantum computers is the dominant issue stymieing the push of quantum algorithms beyond their classical counterparts. We do not expect to be able to afford the overhead required for quantum error correction in the next decade, so in the meantime we must rely on low-cost, unscalable error mitigation techniques to bring quantum computing to its full potential. In this paper we present a new error mitigation technique based on quantum phase estimation that can also reduce errors in expectation value estimation (e.g., for variational algorithms). The general idea is to apply phase estimation while effectively postselecting for the system register to be in the starting state, which allows us to catch and discard errors that knock us away from there. We refer to this technique as “verified phase estimation” (VPE) and show that it can be adapted to function without the use of control qubits in order to simplify the control circuitry for near-term implementations. Using VPE, we demonstrate the estimation of expectation values on numerical simulations of intermediate-scale quantum circuits with multiple orders of magnitude improvement over unmitigated estimation at near-term error rates (even after accounting for the additional complexity of phase estimation). Our numerical results suggest that VPE can mitigate against any single errors that might occur; i.e., the error in the estimated expectation values often scale as O(p2), where p is the probability of an error occurring at any point in the circuit. This property reveals VPE as a practical technique for mitigating errors in near-term quantum experiments.},

	abstract = {The physics of quantum mechanics is the inspiration for, and underlies, quantum computation. As such, one expects physical intuition to be highly influential in the understanding and design of many quantum algorithms, particularly simulation of physical systems. Surprisingly, this has been challenging, with current Hamiltonian simulation algorithms remaining abstract and often the result of sophisticated but unintuitive constructions. We contend that physical intuition can lead to optimal simulation methods by showing that a focus on simple single-qubit rotations elegantly furnishes an optimal algorithm for Hamiltonian simulation, a universal problem that encapsulates all the power of quantum computation. Specifically, we show that the query complexity of implementing time evolution by a d-sparse Hamiltonian {\textasciicircum}H for time-interval t with error ε is O[td∥{\textasciicircum}H∥max+log(1/ε)/loglog(1/ε)], which matches lower bounds in all parameters. This connection is made through general three-step “quantum signal processing” methodology, comprised of (i) transducing eigenvalues of {\textasciicircum}H into a single ancilla qubit, (ii) transforming these eigenvalues through an optimal-length sequence of single-qubit rotations, and (iii) projecting this ancilla with near unity success probability.},

        abstract = {Because quantum simulation of molecular systems is expected to provide the strongest advantage over classical computing methods for systems exhibiting strong electron correlation, it is critical that the performance of VQEs be assessed for strongly correlated systems. For classical simulation, strong correlation often results in symmetry breaking of the Hartree–Fock reference, leading to Löwdin’s well-known “symmetry dilemma”, whereby accuracy in the energy can be increased by breaking spin or spatial symmetries. Here, we explore the impact of symmetry breaking on the performance of ADAPT-VQE using two strongly correlated systems: (i) the “fermionized” anisotropic Heisenberg model, where the anisotropy parameter controls the correlation in the system, and (ii) symmetrically stretched linear H4, where correlation increases with increasing H–H separation. In both of these cases, increasing the level of correlation of the system leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking (parity and S{\textasciicircum}2, respectively) of the mean-field solutions. We analyze the role that symmetry breaking in the reference states and orbital mappings of the fermionic Hamiltonians have in the compactness and performance of ADAPT-VQE. We observe that improving the energy of the reference states by breaking symmetry has a deleterious effect on ADAPT-VQE by increasing the length of the ansatz necessary for energy convergence and exacerbating the problem of “gradient troughs”.},

Our group’s interest in local energy landscapes of unitary ansätze prompted us to investigate the classical approach of truncating the Taylor series expansion (instead of a perturbative expansion) of the UCC with singles and doubles (UCCSD) energy at the second order. This amounts to an approach where the electron correlation energy is estimated by taking a single Newton–Raphson step from Hartree–Fock toward UCCSD. Such an approach has been explored previously, but the accuracy was not extensively studied. In this paper, we investigate the performance and observe similar pathologies to the linearized coupled cluster with singles and doubles. We introduce the use of derivatives of order three or greater to help partially recover the variational lower bound of true UCCSD, restricting these derivatives to those of the “unmixed” category in order to simplify the model. By testing the approach on several potential energy surfaces and reaction energies, we find this “diagonal” approximation to higher order terms to be effective at reducing sensitivity near singularities for strongly correlated regimes, while not significantly diminishing the accuracy of weakly correlated systems.},

        abstract = {Quantum simulation, one of the most promising applications of a quantum computer, is currently being explored intensely using the variational quantum eigensolver. The feasibility and performance of this algorithm depend critically on the form of the wave-function ansatz. Recently in Ref. [Nat. Commun. 10, 3007 (2019)], an algorithm termed ADAPT-VQE was introduced to build system-adapted ansätze with substantially fewer variational parameters compared to other approaches. This algorithm relies heavily on a predefined operator pool with which it builds the ansatz. However, Ref. [Nat. Commun. 10, 3007 (2019)] did not provide a prescription for how to select the pool, how many operators it must contain, or whether the resulting ansatz will succeed in converging to the ground state. In addition, the pool used in that work leads to state-preparation circuits that are too deep for a practical application on near-term devices. Here, we address all these key outstanding issues of the algorithm. We present a hardware-efficient variant of ADAPT-VQE that drastically reduces circuit depths using an operator pool that is guaranteed to contain the operators necessary to construct exact ansätze. Moreover, we show that the minimal pool size that achieves this scales linearly with the number of qubits. Through numerical simulations on H4, LiH and H6, we show that our algorithm (“qubit-ADAPT”) reduces the circuit depth by an order of magnitude while maintaining the same accuracy as the original ADAPT-VQE. A central result of our approach is that the additional measurement overhead of qubit-ADAPT compared to fixed-ansatz variational algorithms scales only linearly with the number of qubits. Our work provides a crucial step forward in running algorithms on near-term quantum devices.},

It provides accurate and size-intensive energy differences corresponding to vertical excitation energies along with vertical ionization potentials and electron affinities.

A family of disentangled UCC wave functions is proven to exactly parameterize any state, thus showing how to construct Trotter-error-free parameterizations of UCC for applications in quantum computing.

Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that, instead of fixing an ansatz upfront, grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters, leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations, including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach, in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy.

The exponential product formula is a good and useful approximant, particularly because it conserves important symmetries of the system dynamics. We focuse on two algorithms of constructing higher-order exponential product formulas. The first is the fractal decomposition, where we construct higher-order formulas recursively. The second is to make use of the quantum analysis, where we compute higher-order correction terms directly. As interludes, we also have described the decomposition of symplectic integrators, the approximation of time-ordered exponentials, and the perturbational composition.},

	abstract = {Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) represent a powerful class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for computing molecular energies. Various numerical issues exist for these methods, however, including barren plateaus and large numbers of local minima. In this work, we consider Adaptive, Problem-Tailored (ADAPT)-VQE ans{\textbackslash}"atze, and examine how they are impacted by these local minima. We find that while ADAPT-VQE does not remove local minima, the gradient-informed, one-operator-at-a-time circuit construction seems to accomplish two things: First, it provides an initialization strategy that is dramatically better than random initialization, and which is applicable in situations where chemical intuition cannot help with initialization, i.e., when Hartree-Fock is a poor approximation to the ground state. Second, even if an ADAPT-VQE iteration converges to a local trap at one step, it can still "burrow" toward the exact solution by adding more operators, which preferentially deepens the occupied trap. This same mechanism helps highlight a surprising feature of ADAPT-VQE: It should not suffer optimization problems due to "barren plateaus". Even if barren plateaus appear in the parameter landscape, our analysis and simulations reveal that ADAPT-VQE avoids such regions by design.},

	abstract = {The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) has emerged as one of the most promising near-term quantum algorithms that can be used to simulate many-body systems such as molecular electronic structures. Serving as an attractive ansatz in the VQE algorithm, unitary coupled cluster (UCC) theory has seen a renewed interest in recent literature. However, unlike the original classical UCC theory, implementation on a quantum computer requires a finite-order Suzuki-Trotter decomposition to separate the exponentials of the large sum of Pauli operators. While previous literature has recognized the nonuniqueness of different orderings of the operators in the Trotterized form of UCC methods, the question of whether or not different orderings matter at the chemical scale has not been addressed. In this Letter, we explore the effect of operator ordering on the Trotterized UCCSD ansatz, as well as the much more compact k-UpCCGSD ansatz recently proposed by Lee et al. [ J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2019, 15, 311. arXiv, 2019, quant-ph:1909.09114. https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09114]. We observe a significant, system-dependent variation in the energies of Trotterizations with different operator orderings. The energy variations occur on a chemical scale, sometimes on the order of hundreds of kcal/mol. This Letter establishes the need to define not only the operators present in the ansatz but also the order in which they appear. This is necessary for adhering to the quantum chemical notion of a “model chemistry”, in addition to the general importance of scientific reproducibility. As a final note, we suggest a useful strategy to select out of the combinatorial number of possibilities, a single well-defined and effective ordering of the operators.},

A great deal of theoretical algorithmic development has been performed in support of this goal. Most techniques require a scheme for mapping electronic states and operations to states of and operations upon qubits. The two most commonly used techniques for this are the Jordan–Wigner transformation and the Bravyi–Kitaev transformation. However, comparisons of these schemes have previously been limited to individual small molecules. In this paper, we discuss resource implications for the use of the Bravyi–Kitaev mapping scheme, specifically with regard to the number of quantum gates required for simulation. We consider both small systems, which may be simulatable on near-future quantum devices, and systems sufficiently large for classical simulation to be intractable. We use 86 molecular systems to demonstrate that the use of the Bravyi–Kitaev transformation is typically at least approximately as efficient as the canonical Jordan–Wigner transformation and results in substantially reduced gate count estimates when performing limited circuit optimizations.},

Commun. 5 4213) with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through a relaxation of exponential operator splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.},

For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ansätze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry—calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He–H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

	abstract = {A unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) form for the wavefunction in the variational quantum eigensolver has been suggested as a systematic way to go beyond the mean-field approximation and include electron correlation in solving quantum chemistry problems on a quantum computer. Although being exact in the limit of including all possible coupled-cluster excitations, practically, the accuracy of this approach depends on how many and what kind of terms are included in the wavefunction parametrization. Another difficulty of UCC is a growth of the number of simultaneously entangled qubits even at the fixed fermionic excitation rank. Not all quantum computing architectures can cope with this growth. To address both problems we introduce a qubit coupled-cluster (QCC) method that starts directly in the qubit space and uses energy response estimates for ranking the importance of individual entanglers for the variational energy minimization. Also, we provide an exact factorization of a unitary rotation of more than two qubits to a product of two-qubit unitary rotations. Thus, the QCC method with the factorization technique can be limited to only two-qubit entanglement gates and allows for very efficient use of quantum resources in terms of the number of coupled-cluster operators. The method performance is illustrated by calculating ground-state potential energy curves of H\$\_2\$ and LiH molecules with chemical accuracy, \${\textbackslash}le 1\$ kcal/mol.},

The algorithm involves implementing a sequence of parameterized gates on quantum hardware to generate a target quantum state, and then measuring the molecular energy. Due to finite coherence times and gate errors, the number of gates that can be implemented remains limited. In this work, we propose an alternative algorithm where device-level pulse shapes are variationally optimized for the state preparation rather than using an abstract-level quantum circuit. In doing so, the coherence time required for the state preparation is drastically reduced. We numerically demonstrate this by directly optimizing pulse shapes which accurately model the dissociation of H2 and HeH+, and we compute the ground state energy for LiH with four transmons where we see reductions in state preparation times of roughly three orders of magnitude compared to gate-based strategies.},

VQE has been proposed as an alternative to fully quantum algorithms such as quantum phase estimation (QPE) because fully quantum algorithms require quantum hardware that will not be accessible in the near future. VQE has been successfully applied to solve the electronic Schrödinger equation for a variety of small molecules. However, the scalability of this method is limited by two factors: the complexity of the quantum circuits and the complexity of the classical optimization problem. Both of these factors are affected by the choice of the variational ansatz used to represent the trial wave function. Hence, the construction of an efficient ansatz is an active area of research. Put another way, modern quantum computers are not capable of executing deep quantum circuits produced by using currently available ansatzes for problems that map onto more than several qubits. In this review, we present recent developments in the field of designing efficient ansatzes that fall into two categories—chemistry–inspired and hardware–efficient—that produce quantum circuits that are easier to run on modern hardware. We discuss the shortfalls of ansatzes originally formulated for VQE simulations, how they are addressed in more sophisticated methods, and the potential ways for further improvements.},

We compare its performance in both efficiency of implementation and accuracy with that of the generalized UCC ansatz employing the full generalized single and double excitation operators (UCCGSD), as well as with the standard ansatz employing only single and double excitations (UCCSD). k-UpCCGSD is found to show the best scaling for quantum computing applications, requiring a circuit depth of O(kN), compared with O(N3) for UCCGSD, and O((N−η)2η) for UCCSD, where N is the number of spin orbitals and η is the number of electrons. We analyzed the accuracy of these three ansätze by making classical benchmark calculations on the ground state and the first excited state of H4 (STO-3G, 6-31G), H2O (STO-3G), and N2 (STO-3G), making additional comparisons to conventional coupled cluster methods. The results for ground states show that k-UpCCGSD offers a good trade-off between accuracy and cost, achieving chemical accuracy for lower cost of implementation on quantum computers than both UCCGSD and UCCSD. UCCGSD is also found to be more accurate than UCCSD but at a greater cost for implementation. Excited states are calculated with an orthogonally constrained variational quantum eigensolver approach. This is seen to generally yield less accurate energies than for the corresponding ground states. We demonstrate that using a specialized multideterminantal reference state constructed from classical linear response calculations allows these excited state energetics to be improved.},

OO-UCC variationally determines the coupled cluster amplitudes and also molecular orbital coefficients. Owing to its fully variational nature, first-order properties are readily available. This feature allows the optimization of molecular structures in VQE without solving any additional equations. Furthermore, the method requires smaller active space and shallower quantum circuits than UCC to achieve the same accuracy. We present numerical examples of OO-UCC using quantum simulators, which include the geometry optimization of water and ammonia molecules using analytical first derivatives of the VQE.},

	abstract = {Applications of quantum simulation algorithms to obtain electronic energies of molecules on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices require careful consideration of resources describing the complex electron correlation effects. In modeling second-quantized problems, the biggest challenge confronted is that the number of qubits scales linearly with the size of the molecular basis. This poses a significant limitation on the size of the basis sets and the number of correlated electrons included in quantum simulations of chemical processes. To address this issue and enable more realistic simulations on NISQ computers, we employ the double unitary coupled-cluster (DUCC) method to effectively downfold correlation effects into the reduced-size orbital space, commonly referred to as the active space. Using downfolding techniques, we demonstrate that properly constructed effective Hamiltonians can capture the effect of the whole orbital space in small-size active spaces. Combining the downfolding preprocessing technique with the variational quantum eigensolver, we solve for the ground-state energy of H2, Li2, and BeH2 in the cc-pVTZ basis using the DUCC-reduced active spaces. We compare these results to full configuration-interaction and high-level coupled-cluster reference calculations.},

Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.},

However, very little is known about the cost function landscape for PQCs, which hinders progress towards quantum-aware optimizers. In this work, we investigate the connection between three diﬀerent landscape features that have been observed for PQCs: (1) exponentially vanishing gradients (called barren plateaus), (2) exponential cost concentration about the mean, and (3) the exponential narrowness of minina (called narrow gorges). We analytically prove that these three phenomena occur together, i.e., when one occurs then so do the other two. A key implication of this result is that one can numerically diagnose barren plateaus via cost diﬀerences rather than via the computationally more expensive gradients. More broadly, our work shows that quantum mechanics rules out certain cost landscapes (which otherwise would be mathematically possible), and hence our results are interesting from a quantum foundations perspective.},

	abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms are proposed to solve relevant computational problems on near term quantum devices. Popular versions are variational quantum eigensolvers and quantum approximate optimization algorithms that solve ground state problems from quantum chemistry and binary optimization problems, respectively. They are based on the idea of using a classical computer to train a parametrized quantum circuit. We show that the corresponding classical optimization problems are NP-hard. Moreover, the hardness is robust in the sense that, for every polynomial time algorithm, there are instances for which the relative error resulting from the classical optimization problem can be arbitrarily large assuming that P≠NP. Even for classically tractable systems composed of only logarithmically many qubits or free fermions, we show the optimization to be NP-hard. This elucidates that the classical optimization is intrinsically hard and does not merely inherit the hardness from the ground state problem. Our analysis shows that the training landscape can have many far from optimal persistent local minima This means gradient and higher order descent algorithms will generally converge to far from optimal solutions.},

The error of TCC scales with the particle numbern, but it is not quadratic in δ. An improved coupled-cluster method (ICC) is presented that is the next step in a hierarchy from TCC to an exact variational theory. An alternative hierarchy is possible that leads to the extended coupled-cluster (ECC) method of Arponen. Variational (VCC) and unitary (UCC) coupled cluster theories and their stationary conditions and errors are analyzed along similar lines and practicable VCC or UCC approaches are presented. An infinite summation of certain terms in the VCC expectation value is shown to lead to a coupled-pair functional of the type proposed by Ahlrichs. The various CC schemes discussed here are compared on the CC-D, CC-SD and CC-SDT levels and beyond this. Special aspects referring to properties are also discussed.},

However, for large systems with many orbitals, the required number of UCC factors still leads to very deep quantum circuits, which can be challenging to implement. Based on the observation that most UCC amplitudes are small for weakly correlated molecules, we devise an algorithm that employs a Taylor expansion in the small amplitudes, trading off circuit depth for extra measurements. Strong correlations can be taken into account by performing the expansion about a small set of UCC factors, which are treated exactly. Near equilibrium, the Taylor series expansion often works well without the need to include any exact factors; as the molecule is stretched and correlations increase, we find only a small number of factors need to be treated exactly.},

	abstract = {Several variants of coupled electron pair type approximations are compared with respect to their accuracy in the prediction of bond distances, harmonic vibrational frequencies and anharmonic corrections for a range of closed-shell diatomic molecules. In the first part of the paper the coupled-electron pair (CEPA) methods (CEPA/1,2,3) are discussed. Extensions of these methods allow the derivation of the correlation energy from the stationarization of a correlation energy functional (CPF/1,2,3 methods). All methods are formulated as diagonally dressed configuration–interaction with single- and double-excitations (CISD) eigenvalue problems. Averaging the diagonal shifts of the CPF methods in various ways lead to the ACPF and AQCC methods. Several small modifications of the shifts for the single excitations are proposed that enhance the stability of the methods (NCPF/1,2,3, NCEPA/1,2,3, NACPF). The reduced shifts are justified by linear response arguments. The implementation of the methods for a closed-shell ground state is described. In the application part, we first tested the size-consistency, exactness for two-electron systems and unitary invariance of the methods. Extensive numerical studies with polarized quadruple-ζ basis sets are employed to test the accuracy of the coupled pair approaches relative to the more elaborate quadratic CI (QCISD) and coupled-cluster (CCSD and CCSD(T)) approaches. Not surprisingly, the CCSD(T) method is the most accurate approach on average. However, the proposed NCPF/1 variant led to even smaller average errors for bond distances (∼0.2pm relative to ∼0.3pm for CCSD(T)) while predicting still accurate harmonic frequencies (av. Error ∼25cm−1 for NCPF/1, ∼8cm−1 for CCSD(T) and ∼45cm−1 for CCSD). All coupled pair methods are more accurate than present day DFT approaches (BP86, B3LYP). The exception is the recently proposed double-hybrid B2PLYP functional that approaches the coupled pair performance. Some more difficult copper containing diatomics are treated as well (CuH, CuF, CuCl and Cu2). We discuss why we believe that the coupled-pair approaches (and in particular the proposed NCPF/1 variant) are attractive for large-scale chemical applications.},

	abstract = {Written by two leading experts in the field, this book explores the 'many-body' methods that have become the dominant approach in determining molecular structure, properties and interactions. With a tight focus on the highly popular Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT) and Coupled-Cluster theories (CC), the authors present a simple, clear, unified approach to describe the mathematical tools and diagrammatic techniques employed. Using this book the reader will be able to understand, derive and confidently implement relevant algebraic equations for current and even new multi-reference CC methods. Hundreds of diagrams throughout the book enhance reader understanding through visualization of computational procedures and extensive referencing allows further exploration of this evolving area. With an extensive bibliography and detailed index, this book will be suitable for graduates and researchers within quantum chemistry, chemical physics and atomic, molecular and solid-state physics.},

A more representative model does not affect much certain resource estimates for a quantum computer such as the cost of a Trotter step, while strongly affecting others such as the cost of adiabatic state preparation. Thus, conclusions should not be drawn from the complexity of quantum or classical simulations of the electronic structure of this system in this active space. We provide a different model active space for the FeMo cofactor that contains the basic open-shell qualitative character, which may be useful as a benchmark system for making resource estimates for classical and quantum computers.},

	abstract = {The many-body expansion (MBE) is an efficient tool that has a long history of use for calculating interaction energies, binding energies, lattice energies, and so on. In the past, applications of MBE to correlation energy have been unfeasible for large systems, but recent improvements to computing resources have sparked renewed interest in capturing the correlation energy using the generalized nth order Bethe–Goldstone equation. In this work, we extend this approach, originally proposed for a Slater determinant, to a tensor product state (TPS) based wavefunction. By partitioning the active space into smaller orbital clusters, our approach starts from a cluster mean field reference TPS configuration and includes the correlation contribution of the excited TPSs using the MBE. This method, named cluster MBE (cMBE), improves the convergence of MBE at lower orders compared to directly doing a block-based MBE from a RHF reference. We present numerical results for strongly correlated systems, such as the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models and the chromium dimer. The performance of the cMBE method is also tested by partitioning the extended π space of several large π-conjugated systems, including a graphene nano-sheet with a very large active space of 114 electrons in 114 orbitals, which would require 1066 determinants for the exact FCI solution.},

The superconducting qubit modality has been used to demonstrate prototype algorithms in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology era, in which non-error-corrected qubits are used to implement quantum simulations and quantum algorithms. With the recent demonstrations of multiple high-fidelity, two-qubit gates as well as operations on logical qubits in extensible superconducting qubit systems, this modality also holds promise for the longer-term goal of building largerscale error-corrected quantum computers. In this brief review, we discuss several of the recent experimental advances in qubit hardware, gate implementations, readout capabilities, early NISQ algorithm implementations, and quantum error correction using superconducting qubits. Although continued work on many aspects of this technology is certainly necessary, the pace of both conceptual and technical progress in recent years has been impressive, and here we hope to convey the excitement stemming from this progress.},

In addition, we discuss what is being done, and what may be required, to increase the scale of trapped ion quantum computers while mitigating decoherence and control errors. Finally, we explore the outlook for trapped-ion QC. In particular, we discuss near-term applications, considerations impacting the design of future systems of trapped ions, and experiments and demonstrations that may further inform these considerations.},

This review represents the first time that the key empirical and ab initio results have been extracted from the extensive NV literature and assembled into one consistent picture of the current understanding of the centre. As a result, the key unresolved issues concerning the NV centre are identified and the possible avenues for their resolution are examined.},

The ability to operate in ambient conditions, combined with the atom-like magnetic Zeeman sensitivity, has also led to intensive investigation of NV centers as nanoscale magnetometers.
